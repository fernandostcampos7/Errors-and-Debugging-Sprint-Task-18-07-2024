# Errors and Debugging

As a developer, you will come across many situations where your code doesn't do what you expect it to. You will experience problems with your code, but not all problems cause errors.

> The series of tasks in [this repo](https://github.com/northcoders/js-intro-debugging-and-problem-solving) will introduce you to some strategies to help you debug your code and identify the area where a problem occurs.

Further challenges will get you to practise your problem solving skills. As you go through those, pay particular attention to the errors in the console when you run the files.

## Learning Objectives

After this sprint, you should:

- Understand when run time errors occur in JavaScript.
- Understand how to read stack traces.
- Understand a general strategy for debugging.
- Be able to use `console.log` to debug incorrect behaviour.

# Debugging Exercises

## Instructions

Take a look at the `exercises` folder. Inside, you will see several files. In each one, some Northcoders staff have written some code. But, despite trying their best, the code is not perfect! Please fix them so that, when you run the file with `node <file name>.js`, all the tests pass.

You do not need to make any alterations to the tests, and make sure to also `cd` into the correct folder before running each file.

# Debugging Advanced Tasks

## Instructions

Now you have completed all of the tasks from the core section, take a look in the `advanced` folder. The idea behind these challenges is the same - read the current function carefully, identify any bugs and use your debugging skills to solve the problems and make the tests pass.

> **Note**: Sometimes, the problem might not even be in the file where the function is written!

# Problem Solving

## Instructions

Navigate to the `problem-solving` folder in the repo you have cloned. The core tasks will be your focus for this section. Work through the challenges in numerical order, referring to the instructions in each file.

# Advanced Problem Solving

## Instructions

Well done on getting ths far! The next set of challenges are located in the `cat-and-mouse` folder inside `problem-solving`, and they are centred around array manipulation. They take the form of a cat and mouse game, where the cat has a set jump length, and it is up to you to work out if the cat can catch the mouse (or mice).

Work through the challenges in numerical order, referring to the instructions in each file. Each challenge has unique specifications, so make sure to read each brief carefully.

# Conclusion

To aim to be a developer who never encounters errors is unrealistic. Instead, you should aim to use error messages to identify problems that prevent your code from running correctly. At other times, your code may be working incorrectly but not causing an error. Use the skills you have developed today to identify and debug the problem yourself.

## As you continue through your Northcoders course, you should:

- Ensure you are reading any error messages clearly and correctly.
- Use a strategy to help you debug and narrow down the problem.
- Use tools like `console.log` and reading an error's stack trace.
